## Story Ideas

### History of the World
- 1000 years ago, the world was ruled by a single powerful empire
- Magic was common and the empire was ruled by a council of powerful mages
- The mages used their power to unite the world and bring peace and prosperity
- The mages were seen as gods by the common folk and were worshiped as such
- In time, the mage council started to call upon Eldritch beings for power and knowledge
- The Eldritch beings corrupted the mages and the empire began to fall into darkness
- Over many years a religious revolution occurred and the mages were overthrown and replaced by a single emperor
- The emperor was a powerful warrior who had been blessed by the god of the sun (primary deity of the church)
- Over the next several generations, the emperor's descendants lost their divine favor and the empire began to crumble
- The Empire eventually fell and the world was plunged into chaos
- Over the next 500 years the church rose to power and the world was divided into kingdoms and city-states
- The Kingdoms and City-States are constantly at war with each other stifling progress and development

### Setting of the Game World
- A world similar to the medieval era
- Magic is rare and mysterious, feared by the common folk, and expressly forbidden by the church
- Common people are superstitious and believe in / fear the supernatural
- Banditry is common and the roads are dangerous
- Two of the most powerful kingdoms are engaged in a cold war and are on the brink of open conflict
- Rumors of a dark cult are spreading throughout the land and the church is aggressively hunting them down
- History is being rewritten by the church to erase the memory of the empire and the mages but hints of the past remain
